# DLP Toolbox: Workplace automation for Delaphone

This is a toolbox I am working on for Delaphone (http://delaphonegh.com). 
It does (or will do) some automation, monitoring and reporting (the stuff
you would expect from a communcations company).

I will eventually be moving the re-usable parts of this to Pigrizia
(https://github.com/lcabrini/pigrizia). One day, dlp-toolbox will depend
on Pigrizia.
